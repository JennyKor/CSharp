# CSharp
<p>All the C# stuff done on Visual Studio from the first year of studies.</p>

<p>OhjelmoinninPerusteet: the basics of C# programming. Looks a bit sparse, but as that was the beginner course I left out the very basic Hello Worlds and such.</p>

<p>OlioOhjelmointi: Object oriented programming excercises. There aren't many of them as the second half of the course was used on learning oop in Unity group project. Unfortunately, those game files are forever lost in depths of Unity collaborate servers...</p>
